# BitRot-micro-fonts

A family of miniature fonts, intended primarily for use on microcontrollers doing graphical video output with limited resolution.
No one stops you from using them in other ways, though - e.g. in pixel art, retro videogames, physical craft projects, Minecraft...
The fonts are mostly US-ASCII complete and range in size from 3x3px to 5x5px.

### Licensing
As I do not agree to the principle of Intellectual Property, these fonts and anything else in here that was created by me *is in public domain*.
Use however you like - modify, sell, whatever. 

If you use this, it will be nice if you refer back here or attribute me.  
If this helps you in a substantial way, it will be very nice if you buy me a beer (or bread or diapers).  
But mostly, **I want to see and hear about stuff you made using these fonts!** Let me see your resolution-limited projects.
If you send me your works, maybe I'll put up a gallery folder.

## BitRot fonts:
The fonts are named BitRot*hhhwww*, where hhh and www are the glyph height and width in binary.
In their folders, you may find the fonts' TrueTypeFont (.ttf) files, a bitmap of all glyphs, a showcase, a .h header file with the font
encoded for C and maybe something else. Feel free to convert to other formats you find useful and send a pull request.
